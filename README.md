# CellFindR
scRNAseq tools for cell clustering

## Introduction
CellFindR is an algorithm that iteratively applies Louvain clustering to single cell datasets in an automated fashion to identify biologically meaningful cell subpopulations.  It utilizes many of the functions within Seurat and is implemented as a wraparound on that package. CellFindR's outputs include matricies with gene expression information for each subpopulation as well as automated generation of violin plots and feature plots for the top differentially expressed genes.  It also includes additional data visualization functionalities.  CellfindR was developed by Kevin Yu in the Tward lab at UCSF.
