# CellFindR
scRNAseq tools for cell clustering

## Introduction
CellFindR is a wraparound for many of the functions that exist in Seurat. It it centered around an iterative clustering algorithm that hopes to find unique cell populations. In addition, CellFindR includes many functions to improve plotting functions and heatmap generations to improve usability for scRNAseq data.
